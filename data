Data Description
In this section I will the data that will be used to analyze the problem of food inspection and the
source of the data. In order to develop a sufficient prediction system, the data should have the
following categories:
• Weather Data- In public health, the weather is a key component. Long rains are associated
with flooding which predisposes to contamination of food with waterborne microbes.
• Crime Data- Higher crime rates have been strongly correlated with poverty due to lack of
employment. Poverty has been in turn correlated with low hygiene which tends to predict
the occurrence of critical violations of food safety regulations.
• Places Data-To help locate food establishments for inspection, there needs to be a way to
pinpoint exactly where they are situated and preferably show it on a map. There are
different sources of places data each which its set of strength and weakness.
• Inspection Data- Inspection data contains information such as previous the history of
critical violations, type of facility, whether the establishment has a tobacco license and the
length of time the establishment has been operating.
• Water and Sanitation data- Garbage and sanitation complaints can be used, together with
other data, to try and predict critical violations. A place with frequent sanitation complaints
is more likely to have a joint with critical violations as compared to another without any
complaint.
• Demographics data- Demographics especially health demographics contain data about
people living around a place including the age, sex, estimated income, occupation, recent
infections all of which can be carefully correlated and used to predict a critical violation.
